				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>What are their demographics? Age, Income, Education, Geographic Location.
                        The demograpnics of this site ranges anywhere from little kids who love basketbll, to international viewing, and even betting. No age limit, it's the best basketball league in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                   How did the site meet the needs of the visitor? If you are searching for scores, you can easily click on games and it will bring up todays games and then you can naviagte to past games and or future match ups.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found. when you click on the three horizontal lines in the top left corner it then shows a drop down menu where you can choose from major categories, such as: tickets, store, top stories, video, standings, stats, players and teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                   What did the site do to make the mobile experience enjoyable (or at least not painful)? When i first started usuing my phone to keep tabs on the National Basketball Association, it did not have a good interface for mobile browsing. So now they just cut down all the options on the main page and put them in short one word choices. Because of this it is more simple and easy to get to hot topics like highlights or top stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment (Think about the descriptions in the Visitor Considerations reading)? If "Yes", how? I thought it did facilitate people in a mobile envirnment but that might just be me. They update the mobile and computer broasing site every year and so it doesnt work super well at first but since its been about 6 months it works very solid. You can stream video easily and then the links with in the sub categories work fantasitc as well. It is simple which allows you to be quick and concise when looking for specific information.
                </p>

                <h1> Worst Site viewed</h1>
                <p>URL:
                    <a href="http://www.arngren.net/">Worst Site Ever</a>
                </p>
                <p>In the worst site i really dont know who the target viewers are. It looks like you would buy something from the site, but its very blah and random. It stresses my eyeballs out. The worst sight did not flow, when you click on a link to check out a product it brings up more information but not a clear path to any answer. You'd have to search it thoroughly before getting anywhere. It is not easy to find anything on this sight, the type of products dont even seem to relate to each other. I dont see a common theme what so ever. Its not built for a moblie so thei links arent big enough to be clicked with ones finger, the alignment sucks, and the location of the images dont have a rule or repetitive line. </p>
