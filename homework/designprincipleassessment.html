            <h1>Design Principles in Mobile Sites</h1>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

            <h2>Proximity &mdash; Jeremy Zelasko</h2>
            <img src='/images/proximity.PNG' alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use" style="width:180px;height:270px;">
            <p>
                www.espn.com
            </p>
            <p>
                Proximity.PNG represents proximity in several good ways. First it lets you know which section you are in; Favorite, News or Now with a close red line. If that red line were any where else it would serve no purpose. An other proximity element is the symbols of the two teams close to the VS. That lets you know who is playing. A lot of these elements are just close enough as well that it looks good without being overcrowded.

            <h2>Alignment &mdash; Jeremy Zelasko</h2>
            <img src="/images/alignment.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use" style="width:180px;height:270px;">

                 td.byui.edu
            </p>
            <p>
                 Alignment.png represents alignment in several ways as well. There are several different menus and headers. However each section is aligned in a distinct way that clearly identifies whats with what. All three green boxs are aligned so you know they are associated. All categories under "Organization Settings" are aligned the same amount so you can tell they are all under Org settings.  These elements repeat them selves nicely throughout the page.

            <h2>Repetition &mdash; DJ Elliott</h2>
            <img src="/images/repetition.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
            <p>
                apple.com
            </p>
            <p>
                Apple is very consistent in the type of repeition they decide to use. Like this scren shot they are describing some basc functions of the apple watch. Because of the similar charcterisitcs it is very easy to read and you are able to locate the most important information on the page. It also is consistent with the buy symbol at the top, because of that repetition it keeps the view of it professional and to the point. They want you to buy their product so they make it easy by following this characteristic.
            </p>

            <h2>Contrast &mdash; Daniel Chase</h2>
            <img src="/images/contrast.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use" style="width:180px;height:270px;">
            <p>
                nhl.com
            </p>
            <p>
                The contrast in colors could be better. They just use different combinations of black and white. They could've added some more variety to the colors that were used by adding the official color of NHL. The contrast in sizes of text is good to let us now the start of a new highlight or story. The different between the navigator bar and the hockey player almost makes you pause and investigate the nature of its puropse and it looks more fun and you might go there first before checking the scores.

            <h2>Typography &mdash; Daniel Chase</h2>
            <img src="/images/typography.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use" style="width:180px;height:270px;">
            <p>
                nhl.com
            </p>
            <p>
                 The basic feeling of the page gives you a bussiness like feel, like you are here to read about the nhl and it works best with this individuals that love the sport or follow it closely. The only variation in text is the titles are bold and a little larger size than the rest. They could've improved the typography by adding differnent styles or colors in the section headings.
